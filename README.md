## How to Play?
<img width="1600" alt="Select image" src="./Woori's_Adventure/bin/images/character_select00.png" />
    ◻ Choose your character and difficulty level

## 1. Basic Control
<img width="1600" alt="Basic_Control" src="./README_FILES/Basic_Control.gif" />

    ◻ If a player press the direction key, the character moves up and down, right and left.
    ◻ The character can use snow particle by space bar.



## 2. Map1
<img width="1600" alt="Map1" src="./README_FILES/Map1.gif" />

    ◻ You have to defeat all ducks to get a key and then can go to next map.
    ◻ If you go out of the map, you will fall, and your life time will be decreased.
    ◻ If you press ‘F1’ key, you can see the graphical help.


| Easy Mode | Hard Mode |
| --------- | --------- |
| <img width="800" alt="Easy" src="./README_FILES/Easy.gif" /> | <img width="800" alt="Hard" src="./README_FILES/Hard.gif" /> |

    ◻ In easy mode, ducks move their own route regardless of character’s movement.
    ◻ In hard mode, ducks will chase the player.


<img width="1600" alt="Triangle" src="./README_FILES/Triangle.gif" />

    ◻ If you defeats all ducks, you can acquire triangle key.
    ◻ You can pick it up by ‘t’ key. If you press ‘t’ key again, you can put it down.



## 3. Map2
<img width="1600" alt="Map2" src="./README_FILES/Map2.gif" />

    ◻ To clear the second map, you have to find a hidden hint in the game.
    ◻ If you just try to cross the land, you will fall. It can be hard to find the bridge, so you can see the hint again by pressing F1 key.
    ◻ In easy mode, we set the boundary for you to not fall off the bridge, so you can easily pass the bridge.



## 4. Map3
<img width="1600" alt="Map3" src="./README_FILES/Map3.gif" />

    ◻ On the final map, you should give a boss slip to put your key since the boss is so fast and never die.
